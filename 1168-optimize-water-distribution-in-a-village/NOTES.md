# IDEA
* **Using Kruskal's algorithm, build a Minimum spanning forest of the village :)**
* Keep in mind to update the cost of the wells of each connected component
* Whenever a hut gets added to a connected component the cost of the well for that hut will now be equivalent to the cost of the hut with the ONLY well for that connected component.
